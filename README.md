# Load-Balancing-Algorithms-in-Cloud-
To perform load balancing, various algorithms were proposed. All previous algorithms focused on balancing the load in datacenters. Balancing the load between datacenters is so effectual that it distributes the workload equally among datacenters which is approved by datacenter brokers and simulates this approach appropriately. The proposed system consists of two stages in load balancing system the first policy is Cloud App Service Broker which manages routing from users to datacenters. The three datacenter policies are Closest datacenter, Optimize Response Time, Reconfigure dynamically with load. The second is provided by VM load balancing algorithms. Three common algorithms are Round Robin, Throttled, and ESCE which will be compared with these three policies. A Cloud Analyst simulates these approaches and results will be on different Parameters which are Overall Response Time, Datacenter Processing Time etc. It mainly focuses to get better response time for respective algorithms. The result will specify the finest possible solution. The further part will be discussed on simulated scenario and broker policy.
